/*
 Œù prisoners, and each prisoner has a unique id number, S, ranging from 1 to N. There are M sweets that must be distributed to the prisoners.

The jailer decides the fairest way to do this is by sitting the prisoners down in a circle (ordered by ascending S), and then, starting with some random S, distribute one candy at a time to each sequentially numbered prisoner until all M candies are distributed. For example, if the jailer picks prisoner S=2, then his distribution order would be (2,3,4...n-1,n,1,2,3...) until all sweets are distributed.

But there's a catch, the very last sweet is poisoned! Find and print the ID number of the last prisoner to receive a sweet so he can be warned.
