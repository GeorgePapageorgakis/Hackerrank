/*
Anna and Brian order n items at a restaurant, but Anna declines to eat any of the k item (where 0 <= k < n) due to an allergy. When the check comes, they decide to split the cost of all the items they shared; however, Brian may have forgotten that they didn't split the k item and accidentally charged Anna for it.

You are given n, k, the cost of each of the n items, and the total amount of money that Brian charged Anna for her portion of the bill. If the bill is fairly split, print Bon Appetit; otherwise, print the amount of money that Brian must refund to Anna.

Constraints:
	2 <= n <= 10^5
	0 <= k < n
	0 <= c[i] <= 10^4
	0 <= b <= Î£ c[i]
